# Welcome to 123NFT!

## Summary

Welcome to 123NFT!

We wanted to make creating NFT’s as easy as 1,2,3 by taking all the complicated and scary programming work OUT of the equation for you - so that all you need to do is insert your content below, provide your pinata API keys and sit back and receive your NFT (well the address that contains your NFT)  which is all yours to do with what you want - sell it, trade it, frame it, you name it!

What is pinata API keys???

Pinata is where your NFT will live. Below, you will be able to add your content (photo, video, soundtrack etc.) and you will receive:
A public key
A secret key
You will need to store these in a safe place as they are the keys that unlock your NFT!

Pinata is a file storage system that keeps your files safe but it is up to you to keep your keys to the safe...safe!

What’s the cost?

As you know, everything to do with the blockchain will cost some moolah. As we are using Ethereum, it will cost some ETH (currency used on Ethereum). You will need to install an application called Metamask which will allow you to have your NFT stored on the blockchain. To use our service of doing it the easiest way will cost you $1. 

Surely there are more costs…

Depending on how big your content is that you’re turning into an NFT, you may incur some storage costs by Pinata. We can handle that but we will need you to chip in as we aren’t any Jeff Bezos’. If your content reaches a certain size, we will charge you a fixed fee per month which will happen without you having to do anything further. If you can’t pay, we will have to restrict your access to the NFT and we don’t want to do that. If you can, all’s well and we will get along just fine!

What happens if I want to sell my NFT to someone else?

Not a biggie. You will just need to notify us and we will change the owner of the NFT for you. A small fee would be charged for the transfer and we advise including this fee in your sale price to pass the fee onto your buyer!
